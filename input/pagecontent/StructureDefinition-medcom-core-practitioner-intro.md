### Scope and usage 

This profile describes the MedComCorePractitioner which is used to describe a Practitioner in a MedCom standard.
The MedComCorePractitioner is inherited from the [DkCorePractitioner](https://hl7.dk/fhir/core/2.0.0/StructureDefinition-dk-core-practitioner.html) profile defined by HL7 Denmark. The only change is that MedComCorePractitioner shall include a name of the practitioner if it is available. 

MedComCorePractitioner is broardly defined (just as it is in the original FHIR ressource and DkCorePractitioner), and may be used to define all the professionals involved directly or indirectly in citizen and patient care and well-being.

Please refer to the tab "Snapshot Table(Must support)" below for the definition of the required content of a MedComCorePractitioner.
