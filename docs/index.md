- [1 Standard documentation](#1-standard-documentation)

This page presents the MedCom Core profiles (Dansk: Kerneprofiler) used in MedCom's FHIR standards. 

These profiles describe fundamental information when exchanging information.Therefore, one or more profiles are included in all MedCom's FHIR standards. The core profiles do not constitute a standard on their own, but the profiles will be used in the standards, such as HospitalNotification or CareCommunication. Thus, this page includes the IG and an introduction to the content of the IG solely and does not include clinical guidelines, use cases, test protocols etc.

## 1 Standard documentation 
In the standard documentation below you will find the necessary content to understand the technical specifications for the standard. 

### 1.1 Technical specification
The technical specifications for the MedCom Core profiles are defined in an IG. 
The <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-core/" target="_blank">MedCom Core Implementation Guide (IG)</a> includes the following profiles:	
* <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-core/StructureDefinition-medcom-core-patient.html" target="_blank">MedComCorePatient</a>

<!-- As mentioned previously the MedCom Core profiles do not alone compose a standard but are used to describe important information in MedCom's standards. 

Understanding IG's might be difficult for people with little or no knowledge about FHIR. Therefore, MedCom has developed a page describing the content of the core IG. The link below gives an overview of the included profiles, what their purpose is, and which elements the system should suppor.  -->
