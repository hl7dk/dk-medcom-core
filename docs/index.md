# MedCom Core 

This page presents the MedCom Core profiles (Dansk: Kerneprofiler) used in MedComs FHIR standards. The MedCom Core Implementation Guide (IG) includes the following profiles:	
* <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-core/StructureDefinition-medcom-core-patient.html" target="_blank">MedComCorePatient</a> 
* <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-core/StructureDefinition-medcom-core-organization.html" target="_blank">MedComCoreOrganization</a> 
* <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-core/StructureDefinition-medcom-core-encounter.html" target="_blank">MedComCoreEncounter</a>  
* <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-core/StructureDefinition-medcom-core-practitioner.html" target="_blank">MedComCorePractitioner</a>
* <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-core/StructureDefinition-medcom-core-practitionerrole.html" target="_blank">MedComCorePractitionerRole</a> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
These profiles describe fundamental information when exchanging information and therefore one or more profiles are included in all MedComs FHIR standard. The core profiles do not alone constitute a standard, but the profiles will be used in the standards, such as HospitalNotification or CareCommunication. Therefore, does this page only include the IG and an introduction to the content of the IG and not clinical guidelines, use cases, test protocols.

## Documentation 

In the documentation below you will find the necessary content to understand the technical specifications for the standard. 

### Technical Specification
The technical specifications for MedCom Core profiles are defined in an IG. As mentioned previously does the MedCom Core profiles not alone compose a standard but are used to describe central information in MedComs standards. Here you can find the <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-core/" target="_blank">MedCom Core IG</a>. 

IGs might be difficult for people with little or no knowledge about FHIR and how to understand an IG. Therefor has MedCom developed a webpage describing the content of the core IG. The link below gives an overview of which profiles are included, what their purpose are, and which elements that shall be supported in a system.
